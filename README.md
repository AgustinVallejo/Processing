# Processing
Some of my Processing Visualization Projects. As you can tell, they are divided between Science and Art. The later folder consists of artistic coding experiments regarding colors, or screen effects. As for the science one, there are some astronomy related simulations or visualizacions, the following of which have a somewhat detailed README document with gifs or pictures:

### Science Projects with README:
+ **Foton:** Simulation of the particle-wave duality of the photon, as well as the color-wavelenght relation. It is interactive with the arrow keys.
+ **Mareas:** Simulation of the effect of the Moon on Earth's tides. It is also interactive: the moon follows the mouse.
+ **PhotonEscape:** Simulation of a single photon escaping the interior of a star. 
+ **Planck:** Interactive diagram of a blackbody spectra. The arrow keys control the temperature.
+ **SistemaSolar:** Just a fun visualization of the solar system. Not really scientifically accurate in any way.
